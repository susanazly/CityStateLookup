# CityStateLookup
This is my first cascade dropdown that includes javascript, HTML, and CSS elements I have learned through this bootcamp so far. This project challenged me to not only debug javascript, but apply elements from everything I have learned so far in this course.

Fun fact I googled, because I asked myself why are we doing this: A cascading (dependent, chained) dropdown is one of the most commonly used web component that dynamically populates a single dropdown select depending on the value selected in another select or a group of selects.

Git Hub Activity also was incorporated into this project:
1. created a repo on git hub
2. cloned
3. Git status
4. made pushes to master branch

note: still need to get comfortable creating branches
